    "          #\"Question 1: Do fires benefit forests?\\n\"\n",
    "          #\"Perspective 1.1: This is because smaller, cooler fires can help to remove any potential fuel like dry leaves, logs, and overgrown shrubs. These smaller fires are not hot enough to damage the established trees, but are still hot enough to rid the forest floor of excess fuel that can feed stronger, hotter, and more dangerous fires.  Provides Habitat In many ecosystems, fires are a natural part of life, and many plants and animals are adapted to regular burns. Small fires that clear out overgrown areas of heavy brush allow room for a variety of new plants to grow. The assortment of new plants provides valuable food and habitat for many wildlife species, encouraging greater biodiversity.  In forests, low-severity fires can help thin the canopy, allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor. For the soil, the combination of new light, open space, and nutrient-rich ash creates the perfect conditions for new seedlings.  Some species have evolved to depend on fires for their reproduction. For example, species like Jack Pine and the majestic Giant Sequoia rely on fire to be able to release their seeds – meaning wildfires are crucial to enabling new growth.  Kills Diseases Another benefit of wildfires is that they can help to kill diseases and harmful insects. The fire helps to suppress the spread of pests and the ash left by the burned vegetation provides a valuable source of nutrients for the remaining trees and plants.  Environmental Harm from Wildfires Air Quality The impact of wildfires on air quality can be immediate as well as long-lasting. The amount of smoke released into the atmosphere can often pose a threat to human health. The fine particles can become lodged in the lungs and place extra stress on the cardiovascular system. These microscopic particles can cause a range of health problems, from sore eyes and a runny nose to chronic heart and lung diseases.1 Wildfires also emit increased levels of carbon monoxide, which can be fatal to humans.  Additional impacts to air quality can occur if the fire comes into contact with buildings, as many modern building materials are highly toxic when burned.\\n\"\n",
    "          #\"Perspective 1.2: Our analysis aims to cover the main economic losses and damages due to fire, but we have not been able to estimate important impacts of fires on biodiversity, employment, subsistence livelihoods, or regional climate. For this reason we are likely to underestimate both the economic costs of fires and the benefits of peatland restoration. Forests and peatlands of Sumatra and Borneo are an important biodiversity hotspot71 and forest degradation caused by fire can reduce the biodiversity value of forests66. Loss and degradation of forests also impacts regional climate increasing local temperature, reducing regional rainfall72 and degrading downstream water availability and quality73. Forest fires also damage non-timber forest products74, which make an important contribution to local livelihoods. Our assessment of the health impacts of fire pollution excludes impacts on mental health and other wider health impacts75 and does not include the public health costs associated with treatment of health impacts. Conversely, fire is an important land management method employed across Indonesia and zero-burn policies can have a negative impact on livelihoods76. Future cost-benefit analysis needs to assess a wider range of impacts to give a more complete picture of the costs of fires and benefits and trade-offs connected to peatland restoration.  Implications for policy Our research has important implications for land management and land-use policy in terms of (i) the loss and damages caused by the use of fire as a land clearing technique, (ii) the cost effectiveness of peatland restoration as a fire prevention strategy, and (iii) the conditions under which peatland restoration can deliver the maximum environmental, economic, and health benefits.  We have quantified the losses and damages associated with fire and show they outweigh the savings made by farmers and land managers using fire instead of more expensive mechanical land clearance.\\n\"\n",

    "          #\"Question 2: Can testosterone increase the risk of prostate cancer?\\n\"\n",
    "          #\"Perspective 2.1: This worldwide database collates information from all prospective studies of hormonal factors and prostate cancer risk, and contains over 17,000 prostate cancer cases with measured hormone levels (including 2,300 aggressive cases) and 37,000 controls. They also obtained genetic data from the PRACTICAL consortium, which contains over 79,000 prostate cancer cases and 60,000 controls.  The researchers investigated the association between blood levels of IGF-1 and free testosterone and the risk of overall, aggressive and early-onset prostate cancer. In addition, they performed a genetic approach known as Mendelian randomisation (MR). This used genetic variants that have previously been associated with levels of IGF-1 and free testosterone to investigate whether those with higher genetically predicted hormone concentrations have an increased risk of prostate cancer. Because these genetic variants are randomly allocated and fixed before birth, MR studies are less likely to be affected by confounding factors or reverse causation than studies which directly measure hormone levels.  Key findings In the blood-based analysis, levels of IGF-1 were positively associated with a greater risk of overall and aggressive prostate cancer. For each standard deviation increase, the risk rose by 9% for each.  This was confirmed in the MR analysis: higher genetically predicted levels of IGF-1 were associated with a greater risk of overall, aggressive and early-onset prostate cancer. For each standard deviation increase in genetically predicted IGF-1, the risk increased by 7%, 10% and 13 % respectively.  In the blood-based analysis, levels of free testosterone were positively associated with a greater risk of overall prostate cancer. For each standard deviation increase, the risk increased by 3%.  In the MR study, higher genetically predicted levels of free testosterone were associated with a greater risk of overall, aggressive and early-onset prostate cancer. For each standard deviation increase in free testosterone, the risk increased by 20%\\n\"\n",
    "          #\"Perspective 2.2: New research presented this weekend at the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Cancer Conference in Liverpool has concluded that men with naturally low levels of the male sex hormone testosterone are less likely to develop prostate cancer than those with higher blood levels of the hormone.  This research, carried out by scientists at the University of Oxford, looked at blood samples from around 19,000 men aged between 34 and 76, collected between 1959 and 2004. 6,900 of these men went on to develop prostate cancer. The scientists divided the men into 10 groups, depending on the level of testosterone in their blood, and compared this to prostate cancer risk.  What’s interesting about this research is that while low levels of testosterone were associated with decreased risk of developing prostate cancer, high testosterone levels were not associated with increased risk. This supports the theory that there are only so many androgen receptors (the proteins that bind testosterone to activate it, so that it can do its job) in the body. So once these are all ‘full up’ with testosterone, it doesn’t matter how much more testosterone is circulating in the blood, because it can’t bind to and activate a receptor. This would explain why high levels of testosterone don’t increase risk of developing prostate cancer, but low levels can lower it.  Testosterone levels alone may not hold the key However, while this research gives some interesting clues about factors involved in causing prostate cancer in the first place – which will undoubtedly prove useful in working out how to one day prevent the disease from occurring – it also raised more difficult questions.  That’s because although men with lower levels of testosterone were less likely to develop prostate cancer, once they did, it was more likely to be an aggressive form of the disease. So far, we don’t have any answers as to why this might be, but it adds yet another layer of complexity to the mystery of prostate cancer development, and opens another avenue of investigation to the scientists set on unravelling these sorts of clues. It also suggests that testosterone levels alone will not hold the key to the causes of prostate cancer development, and\\n\"\n",
